# CSS
## General info
We are currently using [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/) with [narwin-pack](https://github.com/dockyard/narwin-pack).  However, some of our older projects are still written in Sass/SCSS.

## Syntax

* Use soft tabs with two spaces—they're the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.
* When grouping selectors, each selector goes on a new line
* Include one space before the opening brace of declaration blocks for legibility.
* Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line.
* Include one space after : for each declaration.
* Each declaration should appear on its own line for more accurate error reporting.
* End all declarations with a semi-colon.
* Comma-separated property values should include a space after each comma (e.g., box-shadow).
* Don't include spaces after commas within rgb(), rgba(), hsl(), hsla(), or rect() values. This helps differentiate multiple color values (comma, no space) from multiple property values (comma with space).
* Don't prefix property values or color parameters with a leading zero (e.g., .5 instead of 0.5 and -.5px instead of -0.5px).
* Lowercase all hex values, e.g., #fff. Lowercase letters are much easier to discern when scanning a document as they tend to have more unique shapes.
* Use shorthand hex values where available, e.g., #fff instead of #ffffff.
* Quote attribute values in selectors, e.g., input[type="text"]. They’re only optional in some cases, and it’s a good practice for consistency.
* Always use double quotes in selectors and single quotes in the declaration
* Always specify units e.g., margin: 0px; instead of margin: 0;.
* Pseudo element should always have a double semicolon, e.g., .element::after
* Nested selectors should have a space between each block:
```
.element {
  .element__child {
    ...
  }

  @media (...) {
    ...
  }
}
```

## Browser Support
Though specific projects may have different requirements, DockYard code is expected to be compatible with the last two releases of all major browsers:
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari
* IE/Edge

As a result, on most projects we can use Flexbox and/or Grid.

Always be sure to double check with an individual client to confirm browser support.

## General File Structure
Though some projects may have different requirements, DockYard generally has set of starter files such as:
* `app.css`
	* Holds `@import`s of all other css files
* `base.css`
	* Holds your CSS Reset
* `typography.css`
	* Holds all `t-...` styles for typography
* `variables.css`
	* Holds all global variables for a project
* `fonts.css`
	* Holds all `@font-face` declarations
* `layout.css`
	* Holds all global `l-…` styles
* `modules/`
  * Holds all app specific module files:
    * `modules/search-bar.css`, `modules/cards.css`

## Order of Declaration
Most projects should have our [style linter](https://github.com/DockYard/stylelint-config-narwin) installed. The linter helps us to define and maintain an [order of declaration](https://github.com/DockYard/stylelint-config-narwin/blob/master/index.js#L1).

You can also check out the [Linter Styleguide](https://github.com/dockyard/styleguides/blob/master/ux-dev/stylelint-config-narwin.md).

## Variables
Narwin-pack uses [postcss-custom-properties](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties).

Most projects will have a variables file that holds all your global variables. Though there may be times when it makes sense to add variables to individual files, as a general rule variables should live in the variables.css file.
